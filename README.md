## Concurrent transaction execution

The goal of this project is to implement concurrent algorithm (aka. executor) for processing block transactions.

There are currently two implementations:
- `/executor/serial` - sequential (non-concurrent) executor used for testing and benchmarking
- `/executor/parallel` - concurrent executor

See [instructions.pdf](./instructions.pdf) for more info about task requirements.
